Drivetrain SysID tuning TODO list
1. Find slip current limit (what current are the motors drawing when the wheels start slipping)
    Put the robot against a wall and run the motors untill the wheels start slipping
    Find the current the motors are drawing when the wheels start slipping (look in tuner)
2. Do SysID for drive motors
    Put robot in big open area and run the translation characterization command
3. Do Sysid for turn motors
    same as #2 but with steerCharicterization command

Things to find out about the robot
1. Mass 140.4
2. MOI (Cad should be able to give a number for this if their model has accurate materials)
3. Max linear speed (just drive in a straight line)
4. Max rotational speed
5. module positions ( x[forward/back] and y[left/right] ) from the center of the robot in meters
5. exact Drive gear ratio 8.14
6. Dimensions including bumpers 34 1/2 by 39
All of these need to be added to the pathplanner settings
